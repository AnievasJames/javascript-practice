<!-- ---------- LOOPS ---------- -->

What do we use loops for?

Loops repeat the same code over and over again.

Types of loops

- for loop (MOST USED)
- while loop
- do while loop

For Loop

for ( let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {

     console.log(i)

}

Create a variable "i"

Set the variable "i" to 0

Set the variable "i" less than how many times we want to loop (20)

Increment the variable "i" by 1 (i++)
